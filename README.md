# File-Manger
File Manger by python using Tkinter
Python offers various modules to create graphics programs. Out of these Tkinter provides the fastest and easiest way to create GUI applications.

The following steps are involved in creating a tkinter application:

 Importing the tkinter module.
Creation of the main window (container).
Addition of widgets to the main window
Applying the event Trigger on widgets like buttons, etc.
Creating the File Explorer
In order to do so, we have to import the filedialog module from Tkinter. The Filedialog module will help you open, save files or directories.

In order to open a file explorer, we have to use the method, askopenfilename(). This function creates a file dialog object.
